  <h3>Progessive Enhancement</h3>
  <p>The phrase “Progressive enhancement” is somewhat self-explanatory. “Progressive” means that you are furthering something and “enhancement” means that you are increasing the quality of something. So, when you put the two together, you get ‘gradually adding onto and/or improving something’. Many practices follow a model of progressive enhancement. For instance, construction workers begin with the foundation and build up from there. This is in contrast to the graceful degradation model. This would be like building a house, realizing that the structural integrity of the house is too poor to withstand severe storms, and then having to remove a floor of the house to prevent it from caving in. It’s a massive waste of time and money that could have been prevented with a bottom-up approach as opposed to a top-down approach. Sam Dwyer in<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/">“Progressive Enhancement: What It Is, And How To Use It?”</a> summed it up perfectly. Graceful degradation is the journey from complexity to simplicity. As engineers of the web, it is paramount that we follow the philosophy of progressive enhancement to fulfill the goals of another important philosophy that we adhere to: accessibility. It doesn't matter how revolutionary or elaborate your house is, if a person’s machine can’t handle it, the whole thing collapses. </p>
  <h3>Final Revision Reflection</h3>
  <p>Overall, this project, and this class in general, have been some of the most enjoyable experiences I’ve ever had in my career as a student. This project taught me a lot of things. Firstly, I learned just how important progressive enhancement is when I validated my code and had 50+ errors because I had already put on my css which duplicated the errors. Secondly, the project taught me just how many ways you can go about doing something. No matter what you do, there is probably a more optimal way of doing it. I was exposed to this concept with the positioning labs, but playing around with different things like classes and id’s on my final project really cemented it.</p>
  <p>One thing I feel I did well in the final was keeping consistent. On other projects I have done that consisted of multiple parts, my work didn’t seem cohesive. Instead of one project with three parts, they would look like three projects with one part. I feel I did well in making all of the parts gel together and seem like one bigger project. As I referenced in the first paragraph, the main thing I would change if I had to start over would be to take a more progressively enhanced approach to design my final project. It is seriously a pain to go back over and revise countless hours of work that could have been avoided If I had simply taken it one step at a time. </p>
  <p>To obtain criticism for my final revision, I turned to my roommates. There were a few miscellaneous issues like being difficult to read here and there, but the most substantial critique was simply that it didn’t look very good. Functionally, the project was pretty good. Everything worked as intended, and the user experience was as expected, but it was boring and pretty much just atrocious. The vast majority of the revisions took place in the css document. The biggest problem with the styling of my rough draft was that important landmarks like headers didn’t have enough emphasis, so it was very easy to get lost and not be able to find your way back. There was also the implementation of JavaScript that gave it that extra pop that my boring history page needed desperately.</p>
